# Basic TCP Client & Server

This basic TCP Server listens to input from the Client and based on a digit from 1 to 12 returns the month name
It also records all client requests and server replies into a log txt file

*template_TCP_Server_Client.py* and *template_UDP_Server_Client.py* are basic templates for both TCP and UDP servers/ clients
